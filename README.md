I used Microsoft Copilot to assist with this assignment. I provided detailed prompts to help build a Flask JWKS server that returns valid and expired JWTs, handles proper HTTP methods, and passes automated grading via Gradebot. I refined the prompts iteratively based on Gradebot feedback and used AI to tell me what needed to be changed. All code was reviewed and checked before submission. I also used AI to write this as I wanted a summary of the prompts I used. Essentially, I started by copying and pasting the instructions and resource into Copilot, followed its instructions, and if I ran into an error, I would take a screenshot and then upload it into copilot to see what I was doing wrong.
